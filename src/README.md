ROS and QGroundControl Interface
=================================
This is an early version with limited functionalities

To run the system simply use this command "roslaunch mavros ROS_QGC_Interface.launch"

User's care should be taken that chemical data and UGV global position are taken from dummies and rosbag.

Compilation should be done with "catkin build" instead of "catkin_make"

For MAVROS installation and compilation, please refer to https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#installation
